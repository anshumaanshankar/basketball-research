### You are tasked by the scouting department to create a machine learning model that predicts which NCAA players will become good NBA players. How would you approach this problem? Be sure to explain what dataset you would want to use in your answer.

First, we need to define who a "good NBA player" is. For eg, we could make use of a WARP (Wins Above Replacement Player) metric to compare players against others in terms of performance. Taking into account that the average NBA career length is 8.2 years, we can say that an NBA player should be in the top 40% of the WARP metric at least 4 times to be considered a good player.

To predict whether an NCAA player will be "good" in the NBA, we start by identifying good NBA players. First, we would collect 15 years of NBA player stats. For each season, we would calculate every player's Wins Above Replacement Player (WARP) rating. If a player's WARP rating is in the top 40% for at least 4 seasons within these 15 years, we would label them as a "good" player. This gives us a list of players from the last 15 years with a yes/no label indicating whether they are considered good.

Next, we would gather the NCAA data for all players who have played in these last 15 years, regardless of their yes/no label. We would calculate the weighted average of their college stats, factoring in the number of games played to ensure more accurate averages. We would also include other relevant factors such as injuries and games missed due to injury during their time in the NCAA, as these can impact future performance. This results in a dataset where each row represents a player with their average college stats to which we can add the binary label indicating whether they became a good NBA player.

We would then split this dataset into training and testing sets. Using machine learning algorithms, we would train models to learn which attributes are most predictive of becoming a good NBA player and which attributes negatively affect a player's career. We would evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure they perform well.

Once we have a model with sufficient accuracy, we would apply it to current NCAA players. By inputting their college stats into the model, we could predict the likelihood of these players becoming good NBA players. This approach leverages historical data to provide valuable insights into the potential future success of NCAA athletes in the NBA.
