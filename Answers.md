### You are tasked by the scouting department to create a machine learning model that predicts which NCAA players will become good NBA players. How would you approach this problem? Be sure to explain what dataset you would want to use in your answer.

First, we need to define who a "good NBA player" is. For example, we could make use of a WARP (Wins Above Replacement Player) metric to compare players against others in terms of performance. For the rest of this problem, we will use this metric, but it's worth noting that other metrics such as PER (Player Efficiency Rating) or BPM (Box Plus-Minus) could also be considered. Taking into account that the average NBA career length is 8.2 years, we can say that an NBA player should be in the top 40% of a season's WARP metric at least 4 times to be considered a good player.

To predict whether an NCAA player will be "good" in the NBA, we start by identifying good NBA players. First, we would collect 15 years of NBA player stats. For each season, we would calculate every player's Wins Above Replacement Player (WARP) rating. If a player's WARP rating is in the top 40% for at least 4 seasons within these 15 years, we would label them as a "good" player. This gives us a list of players from the last 15 years with a yes/no label indicating whether they are considered good.

Next, we would gather the NCAA data for all players who have played in these last 15 years, regardless of their yes/no label. We would calculate the weighted average of their college stats, factoring in the number of games played to ensure more accurate averages. We would also include other relevant factors such as injuries and games missed due to injury during their time in the NCAA, as these can impact future performance. Additionally, we could consider the average toughness of their college opponents, recognizing that some conferences are more competitive than others. While not easily quantifiable, this parameter could provide further context to a player's performance metrics. This results in a dataset where each row represents a player with their average college stats to which we can add the binary label indicating whether they became a good NBA player.

We would then split this dataset into training and testing sets. Using machine learning algorithms, we would train models to learn which attributes are most predictive of becoming a good NBA player and which attributes negatively affect a player's career. We would evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure they perform well.

Once we have a model with sufficient accuracy, we would apply it to current NCAA players. By inputting their college stats into the model, we could predict the likelihood of these players becoming good NBA players. This approach leverages historical data to provide valuable insights into the potential future success of NCAA athletes in the NBA.

For the datasets, we can scrape Basketball Reference for NBA data and Sports Reference for college basketball data. Both sources provide comprehensive and similar stats, allowing us to conduct a uniform analysis. This ensures consistency and reliability in our data, ultimately leading to more accurate predictions.



### Youâ€™ve built the machine learning model from question 1, and a scout wants some help understanding it. Explain how machine learning models would work in this specific context in one or two paragraphs, using simple language. 

In this context, the machine learning model helps predict whether an NCAA player will become a "good" NBA player. We start by defining a "good" NBA player as someone who has been in the top 40% of players based on their Wins Above Replacement Player (WARP) rating for at least 4 seasons. We collect historical data from the past 15 years, including both NBA performance metrics and NCAA college stats for players who transitioned to the NBA.

The model is trained using this data. It learns to recognize patterns and relationships between a player's college stats and their NBA success. We input various performance metrics like points, rebounds, assists, and factors like games played and injuries. The model identifies which attributes are most important for predicting success. Once trained, we can use the model to analyze current NCAA players. By feeding their college stats into the model, it can predict their likelihood of becoming a "good" NBA player. This helps scouts identify promising talent based on a data-driven approach, making the selection process more informed and accurate.
